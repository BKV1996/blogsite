            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>GyanAdda is a modern and online plateform of knowledge. 
                Our sole perspective is to provide free ‘Digital Knowledge’. <br>I started this plateform to impart 
                the knowledge of various sectors i.e., latest technology, health knowledge, exam related 
                information, etc. 
                <br>After regular approaches and efforts, we will also initiate videos and softcopy of the contents. 
                With the help of this digital initiative, we intend to provide quality-based knowledge to 
                the people. 
                <br>The changes and amendments were made with the change of pace of 
                time. Though our target was costless and quality knowledge to all the people who are either 
                unprivileged or interested in taking the awareness and knowledge in various sectors which are mentioned above. 
                <br>We believe in nurturing people today for a better tomorrow. Knowledge will 
                not just only upgrade the people’s future but will also have an impact on the entire nation’s 
                impact. </p>
